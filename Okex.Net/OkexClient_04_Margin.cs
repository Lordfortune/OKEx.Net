The order type you specify will decide which order parameters are required further as well as how your order will be executed by the matching engine. If type is not specified, the order will default to a limit order. Limit order is the default order type, and it is also the basic order type. A limit order requires specifying a price and size. The limit order will be filled at the specifie price or better. Specifically, A sell order can be filled at the specified or higher price per the quote token. A buy order can be filled at the specified or lower price per the quote token. If the limit order is not filled immediately, it will be sent into the open order book until filled or canceled. Market orders differ from limit orders in that they have NO price specification. It provides an order type to buy or sell specific amount of tokens without the need to specify the price. Market orders execute immediately and will not be sent into the open order book. Market orders are always considered as ‘takers’ and incur taker fees. Warming: Market order is strongly discouraged and if an order to sell/buy a large amount is placed it will probably cause turbulence in the market.
